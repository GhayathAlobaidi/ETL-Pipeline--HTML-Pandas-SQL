A few months ago, I was tasked to outline/draw out a prototype automating a system to go to the educational website, download data, clean it and push it out to SQL.

-This was my response as I continue to learn ways in automating a better system.

-The goal is to download the data convert it into Pandas DataFrame and then push the data into the appropriate SQL tables. 

-The Jupyter notebook shows the thinking along the process.
