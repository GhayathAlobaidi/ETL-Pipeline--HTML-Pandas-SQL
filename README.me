A few months ago, I was tasked to outline/draw out a prototype automating a system to go to the National Center for Education Statistics website NCES, download data, clean it and push it out to SQL.

-This was my response to this challenge and I continue to learn ways in automating a better system.

-The goal is to download the data (in CSV) convert it into Pandas DataFrame and then push the data into the appropriate SQL tables. 

-The Jupyter notebook shows the thinking along the process.
