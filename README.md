A few months ago, I was tasked to outline/draw out a prototype automating a system to log onto the National Center for Education Statistics website, download data, clean it and save it in MySQL.

-This was my response to the challenge while I continue to learn ways in automating a better system.

-The goal is to download the data in CSV format, convert it into a Pandas DataFrame and then push/save the data into the appropriate MySQL tables. 

-The Jupyter notebook shows the thinking along the process.
